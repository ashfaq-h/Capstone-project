# Capstone-project

**SpaceX** advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

Presentation is attached in this report which encapsulates the steps taken to acquire, load, data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visual analysis and predictive analysis done on the data are documented.

In this project, the data was extracted using **RESTful API ** and web scraping on SpaceX website as a part of **EDA** and **data wrangling**. Predictive analysis was performed on classification models and the accuracy of the model predicting the successful landing was found to be **89%**.
